# re-install_script

This script is used to install bioinformatics software on a clean linux (ubuntu-like) install.
This means that libraries can be installed with apt-get.

I'll update this git when i'll have to administer other OS for multiple users.

If course i'll have forgotten some stuff.
Be my guest and report if you find that there's an error anywhere.

This is mostly a reminder for me and my colleagues, use under your own risk.
